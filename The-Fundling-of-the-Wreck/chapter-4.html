  </h2>
  <p>At the mouth of the river Neva were several little islands; on one
   of these islands the Emperor had a hut built for himself, and a
   wooden house for his favourite minister Prince Mentzikoff, who was
   his companion in all his enterprises. It was Peter’s fancy to take up
   his abode on that wild spot and watch the progress of the city he had
   planned. On another of these little islands a fortress was reared,
   surrounded by a rampart of earth. This fortress was the station of
   the engineer who directed the works, and the home of a few of the
   soldiers. The inhabitants of Moscow were at first jealous of the new
   city. They foresaw that it would, in the course of time, from its very
   situation, be a more desirable abode for purposes of trade than the
   ancient capital; and they greatly opposed the plan, lest their dignity
   should decrease as well as their interests suffer; but the Czar was
   not a man to yield to any, however high their rank might be; and he
   persevered with his plans without regarding the dissatisfaction which
   was so generally expressed. The houses of the new city were at first
   built wholly of wood, and chiefly inhabited by foreign artisans. Peter,
   seeing that the Russian nobles and wealthy merchants would not of
   their own free-will take houses in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg, published a decree
   obliging them to do so. At the same time, however, he gave orders that
   the houses in the best part of the city should be built of bricks and
   roofed with tiles. He also made a law (there being no stone-quarries in
   the neighbourhood) that every large vessel which came into the port
   should bring thirty stones, and every boat ten, towards the erection of
   bridges and other public buildings. Every peasant’s cart was likewise
   compelled to bring three stones; and by these means materials were
   raised free of cost for the public works.</p>
  <p>As the place at which Michael was set to work was not many miles
   distant from the abode of his family, he had an opportunity of
   seeing them occasionally, which was a pleasure denied to most of the
   labourers. Margaret and Gerald often went together, and though it was
   frequently the case that they were only allowed to speak with him for
   a few minutes, they were glad to undertake the journey even for that
   brief joy.</p>
  <p>As Gerald was too young to carry on the fishing craft alone, he and
   Margaret resided wholly with her parents. Gerald helped the old man to
   make and mend fishing-tackle, which was now their principal means of
   support; and Margaret did anything she could to earn a trifle, still
   their circumstances were very much worse than when Michael was at home
   following his trade. Though Michael was naturally strong, and had all
   his life been used to hardship, he could not bear the labour to which
   he was set, so well as many of his companions. The air of the marshes
   was very different from the sea-breezes, but the principal cause of
   his sinking under his toil was, his spirit was crushed. While a man
   possesses a feeling of independence, he may meet difficulties and
   hardships with a bold front; but when he feels himself to be a slave,
   (and these poor people were slaves though they bore not the name,) his
   energies are in most cases benumbed, and his spirit is broken.</p>
  <p>Margaret used to look very sad and often to weep, when she and Gerald
   returned from their visits to the works, for with the keen eye of
   affection she saw what he was suffering,
   though he said not a word.
   On the contrary, when in her presence, he put on as cheerful an aspect
   as possible. At such seasons Gerald always tried to comfort her, <q>Good
   mother,</q> he said one day, <q>do not, I beg of you, give way so to grief,
   I am sure you will have father at home again before very long.</q></p>
  <p><q>How can that be child?</q> she asked. <q>You see the Emperor does not let
   any of the men give up the work until they are carried off by death.
   No, there is no hope for my poor Michael; for he will die before this
   huge city is finished.</q></p>
  <p><q>Oh no, he will not die, mother,</q> cried the boy, <q>I feel sure he will
   not die! You know you have yourself taught me that God takes care of
   good people, and I am sure father and you are good. You have taught me,
   too, that God hears our prayers if we pray to him with sincerity; and
   I have prayed very earnestly and very often that he would bring dear
   father back. Courage, good mother, do not weep; you will have him with
   you again, and that before long.</q></p>
  <p>We must now tell our young readers that Gerald had formed a
   determination to offer himself as a substitute in Michael’s place. He
   made this resolution very soon after the fisherman was taken from his
   family; but he well knew that would not be the time to put it into
   practice, as he was not then eleven years of age. He hoped however,
   in about two years</q> time, to be suitable in appearance as well as
   strength, and otherwise fitted to undertake the task.</p>
