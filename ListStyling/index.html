        <h3>CLINICAL PARTICULARS</h3>

        <h4>Therapeutic indications</h4>
        <p>Cefixime is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked <i>in vitro</i> bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism.</p>
        <p>It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused bu susceptible microorganisms:</p>
        <p><b>Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI):</b> e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk.</p>
        <p><b>Lower Respiratory Tract Infections</b> e.g. bronchitis.</p>
        <p><b>Urinary Tract  Infections</b> e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, uncomplicated pyelonephritis.</p>
        <p>Clinical efficacy has bee demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occuring pathogens including <i>Streptococcus pneumooniae</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, <i>Kliebsiella species</i>, <i>Haemophilus inflienzae</i> (beta-lactamase positive and negative), <i>Branhamella catarrhalis</i> (beta-lactamase positive and negative), and <i>Enterobacter species</i>. Cefixime is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.</p>
        <p>Most strains of enterococci (Streptococcus faecalis, group D Streptococci) and Staphylococci (including coagulase positive and negative strains and meticillin-resistant strains) are resistant to Cefixime. In addition, most strains of Pseudomonas, bacteroids fragalis, Lysteria monocytogens and Clostridia are resistant to Cefixin.</p>

        <h4>Dosage and Administration</h4>
        <p>Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required.</p>

        <h4>Contraindications</h4>
        <p>Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics or any of the other components of the product. </p>
        <h5>Adults and Children over 10 Years:</h5>
        <p>The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses.</p>
        <h5>Elderly:</h5>
        <p>Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment (See "Dosage in Renal Impairment"). </p>
        <h5>Children (Use Paediatric Oral Suspension): </h5>
        <p>The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses.</p>
        <p>Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years should be treated with the recommended adult dose (200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection). The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children less than 6 months.</p>
        <p>Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime tablets may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.</p>
        <p>Mode of Administration: For oral use.</p>

        <h4>Special Warnings and Precuations for use</h4>
        <p>Severe cutaneous adverse reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in some patients on cefixime. When severe cutaneous adverse reactions occur, cefixime should be discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures should be taken. </p>
        <p>Cefixime should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. </p>
        <p>Hypersensitivity to penicillins </p>
        <p>As with other cephalosporins, cefixime should be given with caution to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillin, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and cephalosporins.</p>
