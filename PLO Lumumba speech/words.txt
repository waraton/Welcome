it start by recognizing the vice Chancellor of
the University of Dar Salam. Permit me also to
recognize the deputy Vice Chancellor and to recognize
Professor panina Mlama and in the audience permit me to
recognize Mzee Marioba Malot, I recognize you, I also
take this opportunity to recognize the other academics
who are present here, the students who are here,
and members of the press. I’m so very happy to be
invited once again to be present with you to
celebrate and commemorate the life and times of Mwalimu
Julius Kambarage Nyerere. I first came to Tanzania as a
student on the 9th day of December 1984 when I was a
student leader at the University of Nairobi and
the then president of Kenya invited me among other
students to accompany him and that is when I met
Mwalimu Nyerere.
I then 10 years later in 1994 visited at the
invitation of Professor Haru Bothman on the
occasion of 40 Years of celebration of leadership in
Africa and that is when I formally was introduced to Mwalimu
Julius Kambarage Nyerere and his foundation. it’s Therefore
gladdens my heart that I’m in the country of
a man whom I admire and in a hall named after and in a
hall that is named after another great African
the for Dr Nkwame Nkrumah. The subject that has preoccupied
us in the last few days is one that
is as topical as it is relevant. The rise or fall of
Africa on account of the African politician. And
in order to do justice to that subject and to remain
faithful to My Chosen subject which is a call
for Hygiene in African politics there is a sense in
which one must take a historic Journey if only
to appreciate the factors that animated Africans to
seek to regain their independence from the
colonial Masters historians will remind us that we
were fast enslaved that Africans were taken and this
we seldom say the first civilization to take Africans
out of this continent were the Arabs and they
took Africans from the eastern coast and it’s said that
in that part of the world there are not many
Africans who remained because it was in the business
of the Arab enslaver to castrate Africans we never say
that but we must say it because it is historically
significant then the Europeans came the
Portuguese came the Spaniards came the Germans came
the French came the belgians came Africa became the hunting
ground for the European colonizers and we were the
spot we built our ancestors built the United
States of America our ancestors built Europe and when
slavery had lost its  shine and Sheen the
Europeans abolished it but they replaced it with yet
another pernicious Enterprise the colonization of Africa.

The Europe sat in Berlin in  Germany in 1884 and they
looked at the map of Africa and parceled it out.
the British had their share the Germans had their
share and Tanzania or Tanganyika was their share
as was Rwanda and urundi the Spaniards were joury come
lately is in the arena and they got little
Equatorial  Guinea and Southwest Africa the French
 were here the Portuguese were here. and we were
colonized.

This time round they did not take us away
they came here and they controlled us and they told
us not in so many words that we were children of a
Lesser God. And  we were treated as if we were
children of a Lesser God in fact they told us that on
the day of creation we were merely hewers of
wood and drawers of water and if anybody were to doubt
it in 1948 it  was more blatant when Hendrick faot
instituted the Apartheid regime in South Africa. 

But yet there is a sense in which the God that we
worship never sleeps the.  colonial Enterprise ran its
course and the  European tribes the Europeans never
called themselves tribes they called them nations were
engaged in a war first in 1918 the European
tribes fought and they had  something called the
League of Nations  which died then they fought again in
in  1945 and what is unique about the European
 nations is that when they are engaged in Tribal wars
they called them world wars. so there was another war
between 1945 1939 and 1945 and after that a new
kid on the Block the United States of America took the
lead in saying that colonialism was something
that was undesired 

but at that time Africans were
never quiet. those who had been taken out had already
started agitating. many of us here will remember Marcus
Gavy of whom Bob Mary says gavy was a Buffalo
Soldier in the heart of America and many of us will
remember the WEB DBua many of us will remember
that they started agitating that Africans must regain
their dignity and their independence and indeed
in 1847 in Liberia a small group of Africans were
brought back in Monrovia and Liberia became the
first independent black nation in the continent of
Africa so soon thereafter in Siera Loene they also
created yet another Colony 

but Africa was colonized
except Ethiopia which they tried to take in 1938
and exiled Professor Dr Heil Selasi and unfortunately they
were defeated as you remember in the Battle of
Adowa. Africa can defeat European tribes. this history is
necessary that we are able to appreciate the
freedom that we gained so that Gavi came WB dBua came
but there was another crop after the 1940s who had
had the advantage of European education and there are
people in Europe also who are beginning to
recognize that indeed equality was necessary and this
was not anything new in 1776 in the United States of
America the American state sitting in Philadelphia in
the United States of America declared unto
themselves that all men are born equal that they are
endowed by their Creator with sat alienable
right that among those are life liberty and the
Pursuit of Happiness 

a few years later in France After the
Revolution they also recognized that we were to be
equal so that the colonized Nations which had
now taken Africans thought that they were safe they
had taken Leopold Sedar Sango from Senegal to Pari and
they thought that they were creating a little French
man little did they know that they were creating
somebody who would want to overthrow them they took
Felix Bu from Cote D'ivore and they thought that they
were creating somebody who would be subservient to
them they took Ahmed Seko Toure and Modibo Keita and they thought
they were safe little did they know that they were
creating the Future Leaders and agitators
against French colonization 

and it did not stop there
the Portuguese also took Agustino NATO and Amica Cabral
and they to adamon Lane to Lisbon. little did they know
that those individuals would be the
Catalyst that would be necessary in the process of
decolonization. the British also had their fair
share they took others they took mimar Hastings kamuzu
Kenneth David Kaa and many others to the United
Kingdom J Kenyata little did they know that those
would be the individuals who sometimes later and
in Ghana of course they took the foruma and in Nigeria
they took Dr namik Abu bakar tala and
sah the S of soot there is a sense therefore in which
these individuals started recognizing that
having been enslaved having been colonized we now had
to liberate ourselves and the agitation started and
kukuma and his Ghana acquired Independence in 1957 and
I still can hear Nkwame Nkrumah through  the
vicissitudes of time saying in Akra Ghana that Ghana
is free and will never be colonized again but the
freedom of Ghana means nothing if the rest of Africa
is not free I can hear I can hearu Julius saying
that is prepared to delay the independence of
tanganika so that tanganika Kenya Uganda would become
independent at one time mimu could see the future with
the exactitude of a Jewish prophets J kinata and
obote could not and therefore we gained independ are
separate states and the story will be told
shortly so what do we see the agitation the demand by
the people that we must be decolonized and why is it
that we were asking that we must be decolonized why is
it that we are demanding that we must regain
our independence because throughout the ages it was
always the divine plan that men must be masters
of their Destiny and when we gained our independence
the leaders of the day were eloquent as they
were clear that the reason why we were asking to be
independent is because we wanted to take charge
of our Affairs we wanted to be the governors we wanted
to have our young men and women acquire
education we wanted to control the production of our
food through agriculture we wanted to build our
infrastructure we wanted to improve improve the
quality of the lives of our people by improving their
health we wanted to eliminate poverty we were clear on
what we wanted and this message was as clear in West
Africa as it was clear in East Africa as it was clear
in central Africa as it was clear in Northern
Africa so that if you listen to quame uruma is as if
you’d listen to atino Nato and if you listen to
Nato it’s as if You’ listen to Samora Moses
Melle and if you listen to Ahmed Ben Bella in
the mreb is as if you’d listen to Patrice Emy
lumumba there is a sense in which there was
unanimity that this was the only way and we attained
Independence and I remember saw very vividly in
1957 s in Casablanca Morocco was it in 1960 when the
then eight independent African countries met on
the foruma was clear that we must ensure that
everybody else regains their independence and
that we must remember that the colonial Master is not
asleep and that if we don’t unite he’ll
come under other guises through the neoc colonial
project but they listened to kukuma not and even
before they assembled in 1963 in the month of May in
Adis SAA Ethiopia no sooner had countries
started attaining Independence that the colonial Pro
neoc Colonial project started taking roote and in
1960 the first cudit and assassination took place in
Togo when syanu Olympia was eliminated one year later
Patrice Emir lumumba was eliminated so that in 1963 in
the month of May when 32 heads of states and
government assembled in Adis Sababa Ethiopia there
were several speeches but three speeches Stand
Out Kuma speech M speech and Emperor Hai speech hassi
 was the host and is in all in own inimitable
style he reminded the congregation who are present in
Africa Hall in Adis Sababa Ethiopia that that
was a momentous occasion and that the long-term health
of Africa not only required but demanded that
Africa must pull in the same direction haasi said andu
took the Baton from haasi and repeated the same
words celebrating the fact that we were independent
and we had the opportunity of determining in our
Affairs but the greatest of the speeches was that of
theuma had a sense of urgency which everybody
else did not have he said not in so many words but in
effect that if we want to immunize ourselves
from the Diabolical machinations of the aswh colonial
Master now turned neoc colonizer we have to move
here as one Africa with the United States of Africa
with one Army with one currency with one Central
Bank and with one nation but they listen to him not
they had started getting used to the trappings
of power so what they came out with on that day in the
month of May 1963 was a weak organization of
African Unity the oou which many commentators were
quick to describe in many ways and many times as the
toothless Bulldog it was never a dog he did not have
teeth but the effect of it is that he did not do
very much some say it was a talking shop MOBA who was
then active in political life and in other
sectors will attest to that yet later we were to
create another body the African Union and we’ll
have something to say about that so we come out of
Adis Sab by Ethiopia in 1963 clear as to what we want
to do the African politician begins to emerge we have
them in different parts but they begin to show
characters that are to totally inimical to our
expectations you of <p t="1175130" d="5669" w="1
">[Applause] say they started getting used to the
trappings of power and we started having
countries which we thought would liberate us and I’m
talking about the hygiene of the politics it
started disappearing many of these individuals now
thought that they were demig Gods suffering from
what I call the Messiah complex thinking that they had
been brought to Africa to liberate her and
that they suffered from two major diseases one of them
is the mat syndrome and the other one is the
Messiah complex they think that they their countries
owed them Africa started producing leaders that one
cannot recognize how many of you will forget jahel
basa of Central African Republic that man who
murdered little children in the streets because they
did not buy uniform from his wife that J Bas how many of
you will will forget who changed his country’s
name and presided over a kleptocratic regime the
Democratic Republic of Congo is the richest resource
country on Earth conservatively decide that
under her belly she has minerals which is equivalent
to 34.1 trillion United States dollars and yet today
it is one of the poorest Nations on Earth it is the
only nation on Earth which the day of the
election has its president saying we know we ought to
have elections but we have no money to hold elections
when you see a country which has as its official name
the Democratic Republic of Congo know that there
is no democracy in fact I dare say that any country
two countries that I know insisting on having as
a part of the official name the Democratic Republic of
something are never Democratic the other one
is Korea the people’s Democratic Republic of Korea
is as if when you can’t graduate to be a
doctor you go to the church and you ask to be baptized
as Dr madim but that is not the point the point is
that who can forget mut who can forget ID of ugand who
can forget meist to ha maram over ethopia and
one can go on and on because hygiene had started
disappearing from African politics our
agriculture was beginning to suffer European musicians
who had a little sense of guilt came to perform in
Africa Bob gof to free the Ethiopians out of hunger
there was no hygiene in our politics we could not run
our education systems our young men and women were
going to India because the budgets meant for
Education were consumed by individuals whom we had
entrusted with the task of presiding over it our
health sectors were beginning to collapse and as I’ve
said before the political leadership did
not have any faith in those institution typically the
typical African politician perhaps not in
Tanzania today if they were sick they had a call they
would not go to mimil they would go to London if they
were Kenyan they would not go to Kenyata hospital they
would run to the United Kingdom tragedy no
hygiene in our politics because Africans had started
engaging in theft in fact I used to say that
African politicians were thieves then I went to Uganda
and I was told that they are not thieves they
are looters and when I went to Liberia last week they
I was told they are not looters I was told they
are looters on an industrial scale that is The Logical
metamorphosis of the African politician whose
appe for public wealth is completely insatiable
hygiene was disappearing from African politics and we
could see the effect of The Disappearance of hygiene
in African politics but there was always the IC
wild po Colonial Master to assist who deters started
visiting Africa in was consumed namik in Nigeria
was consumed the foruma was consumed Apollo Milton Obote
was consumed a mil cabal in Guinea BAU was
consumed Patrice lumumba was consumed CS were so
frequent in Africa that afro pessimist were now
hard to say that coups were as frequent as breakfast
but even breakfast was not frequent on African
tables we could not feed ourselves because there was
no hygiene in African politics your typical African
politicians took the view that they had a Divine
mission to preside over their countries they
arrogated to themselves the Monopoly of wisdom if you
listen to some of them and I listen to the radio
announcements announcing the activities of one leader
of an African country Hab man juvenile it would
take three minutes to say the things that he had done
