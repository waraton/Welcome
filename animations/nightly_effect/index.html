    <h2>will you go <span>to heaven?</span></h2>
      <section>
        <p>Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, <abbr title="But I say unto you, &NewLine;That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her &NewLine;hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.">Mt.5 28</abbr>)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. <strong>If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called hell.</strong></p>
        <h3>There’s good news!</h3>
        <p>Though we broke God’s Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: <q>For God so love the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life</q> (<abbr title="John">Jn. 3:16</abbr>).</p>
        <h3>Jesus rose from the dead!</h3>
        <p>He was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior.</p>
        <h3>Repent & Trust in Jesus!</h3>
        <p>For it is by grace that God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (<abbr title="For by grace are ye saved through faith; &NewLine;and that not of yourselves: it is the gift&NewLine;of God:Not of works, lest any man &NewLine;should boast.">eph. 2:8,9</abbr>). Read the Bible and obey it, find a good Church to help you grow and tell others about the <strong n>GOOD NEWS!</strong></p>
