   <span class="small">A GREAT AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE—OUR HERO IN MOSCOW.</span>
  </h2>
  <p>When Gerald had been about six months at his new employment, to his
   great surprise he was one morning told by an inspector of the works,
   that an order had just come from the Emperor signifying that he was to
   be sent immediately to Moscow.</p>
  <p>This intelligence created a little alarm in the breast of the youth,
   for he could only suppose that he was suspected of having committed
   some offence. Conscious, however, of having discharged his appointed
   duties with faithfulness, he asked the officer whether he were sure
   that he was the person mentioned in the royal letter.</p>
  <p><q>The person signified is called by the name of Gerald Kopt. His person
   is described, and the description answers exactly to you.</q></p>
  <p><q>I am called by the name of Gerald Kopt,</q> the youth replied, <q>and if
   the Czar commands me to go of course I must obey. Indeed I have no
   objection to going. But should my mother come here and miss me, who
   will let her know whither I am gone?</q></p>
  <p><q>I will engage that your mother shall be told all that we know
   concerning you,</q> replied the officer.</p>
  <p><q>Many thanks for that kindness,</q> cried Gerald, looking gratefully in
   the man’s face, <q>I am now ready to attend the Czar’s orders.</q></p>
  <p>Could Gerald have divested himself of the idea that he might be going
   as a culprit to be tried for an unknown offence, he would have been
   delighted with the journey, for he had long had a strong desire to see
   more of the world.</p>
  <p>The distance from <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg to Moscow, which is upwards of four
   hundred miles, was a formidable journey in a country where the roads
   were bad, and there were very few inns. At a subsequent period the
   Emperor Peter had good roads made between the large towns, and inns and
   posting-houses were built upon them. Canals were also dug to connect
   the great rivers, and there were many improvements of a similar kind;
   but these things were the work of considerable time. Some of them were
   only just commenced at the period of which we are speaking.</p>
  <p>On their way to Moscow the party passed through the town of Novogorod,
   the seat of the earliest government, and afterwards so noted as a
   republic. Gerald was greatly pleased that he had an opportunity of
   visiting this place, for Michael and his father-in-law had told him
   something of its ancient history. How about the middle of the ninth
   century, Rusic, a Norman pirate chief, when cruising about the Baltic
   with his followers had sailed down rivers and through lakes till
   they came to this city, which was then a mere cluster of wooden huts
   inhabited by barbarians, and how the Norman had made himself master of
   the place, assumed the title of Grand Duke, and laid the foundation of
   the present powerful and extensive empire of Russia.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1"
    id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a> Many legendary
   tales were told of the adventures of these wild Normans, and most of
   these adventures were associated with the city.</p>
  <div class="footnote">
   <p><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_1" id="Footnote_1">[1]</a>
    Igov, the son of Rusic, afterwards made Kirow the capital
    of the country; but Novogorod was for a considerable time a place of
    importance, and the chief city of a republican state.</p>
  </div>
  <p>On reaching Moscow our hero was so interested in the place as to forget
   the painful circumstances under which he was visiting it. The city
   was at that period enclosed with three
   walls; one built of brick,
   surrounded that portion called the Kremlin, where the Czar’s palace and
   the residences of the chief of the nobility stood; another built of
   stone, took in a larger extent of the city; and a third formed of wood,
   enclosed the suburbs. On the banks of the river Moskwa, which runs
   through the city, were a number of wooden huts, the public baths. These
   baths were constantly frequented by the inhabitants, as bathing was at
   that time a religious ceremony amongst the Russian people. The poorest
   classes never failed to attend the baths at least once in the week.</p>
  <p>It was Palm Sunday when Gerald and his companions arrived, the place
   was consequently in a state of universal excitement. The bells too
   were ringing merrily. Moscow was famous for the size and number of
   its bells. To present a large bell to a church was considered by
   some a very pious act, therefore almost every new sovereign had a
   bell cast larger than that which had been given to the city by his
   predecessor.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2" id="FNanchor_2">[2]</a> Palm Sunday was a day on which
   a very grand festival
   was always held. The religion generally professed in Russia is
   according to the Greek Church, which is very similar to the Roman
   Catholic religion. At that time the church was governed by persons
   called Patriarchs, who were something like the Popes. The Patriarch
   lived in Moscow, in a palace adjoining that of the Emperor where he
   kept a court, and lived in as much state as the Czar himself.</p>
  <div class="footnote">
   <p><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_2" id="Footnote_2">[2]</a>
    The Empress Anne, the daughter of Ivan, who reigned soon
    after Peter’s death, presented a bell to the city of Moscow which
    weighs 432,000 pounds, and is the largest bell in the world.</p>
  </div>
  <p>On the festival of Palm Sunday the emperor always walked to church,
   gorgeously arrayed in a dress made of cloth
   of gold, two princes
   holding up his train. He was followed by a grand foot procession
   consisting of the whole court splendidly attired. Behind the nobles
   were a number of the chief citizens and lawyers, each having a branch
   of willow, to represent palm, in his hand, and beyond these were the
   guards of the palace. In this procession the Patriarch always rode
   beside the Emperor, who held the bridle of his horse, and he was the
   only person mounted, excepting the guards.</p>
  <p>Our hero and his companions met the procession as it was just leaving
   the palace, and they stood for a while to watch it pass. Gerald’s
   associates were delighted at having arrived in time to witness it,
   and Gerald was himself pleased with the sight, for he had never seen
   anything of the kind before. But looking on it as a religious festival
   he could not help feeling pained. These men he knew were about to fall
   before images and offer up prayers to saints and angels, and they
   would afterwards spend the sacred hours of the Sabbath in feasting and
   drinking; for no religious festivals were at that time held in Russia
   without feasting and drinking to excess. Happily for our young hero he
   had been taught a purer faith. The Bible, Michael’s best inheritance
   from his father, had not been made such poor use of, as to allow Gerald
   to imbibe the superstitions, and practice the foolish ceremonies of the
   Russians.</p>
