  <p>Madame Koski now proceeded to question Gerald regarding his humble
   friends, the fisherman and his wife, and nothing loth was he to talk of
   them, and of their kindness to him. She listened with great interest to
   his account of Michael’s being carried off to the public works, and of
   his interview with the Czar, to plead for the exchange. She had heard
   nothing of these particulars—she had only been told that a youth who
   had been shipwrecked when an infant, near the mouth of the Neva, was
   then, at the Emperor’s palace, and on her arrival, the paper which
   Gerald had written out had been put into her hand. Peter, on first
   seeing him, had himself been struck with the resemblance he bore to
   his early friend, and when Gerald proceeded to give the account of the
   wreck, he immediately surmised that the son of the Polish noble stood
   before him.</p>
  <p>Though Peter was a man of fierce passions, and had little feeling, he
   was known to attach himself firmly to a few individuals. Madame Koski
   and her son, therefore felt some confidence in the continuance of his
   friendship and protection.</p>
  <p>Gerald at last came to a determination to enter the University, though
   his own inclination would now have led him to go to his native land,
   and make a stand with the few brave men who would have joined him in
   another struggle for independence. Indeed, he did not wholly relinquish
   the idea, though he resolved at present on making the most of the
   advantages offered him for education.</p>
  <p>Previous, to his entering, however, he and his mother took a journey
   to the village in which Michael and his wife were residing. Madame
   Koski was anxious to see the worthy couple who had acted so kindly to
   her son, that she might have an opportunity of expressing her deep
   gratitude, and she and Gerald were both desirous of ascertaining
   whether they could do anything to make the family more comfortable.</p>
  <p>The meeting was affecting, and it gave mutual pleasure. Madame Koski
   was much pleased with the fisherman’s family, especially with Margaret,
   towards whom she thought she could never show sufficient kindness in
   return for the motherly part she had acted towards her friendless
   infant. The good woman brought forward the clothes in which Gerald was
   dressed when he was first cast upon their protecting care. And if any
   further proof of his identity had been needful, the sight of them would
   have quite satisfied Madame Koski that he was indeed her child. The
   view of the clothes, however, called forth many painful recollections,
   for though Gerald was restored to her, her two other children, who had
   been equally dear were lost. She was affected too when told of the
   careful manner in which the babe’s little ark had been enclosed, in
   order to shelter him from the waters. <q>Poor Jaqueline,</q> she said, with
   tears in her eyes, <q>you were faithful to your charge to the very last.
   Oh!</q> she added, turning to her son, <q>what a wonderful providence has
   followed thee, my child, from the moment I parted from thee, thou has
   never wanted a mother’s tender care.</q></p>
  <p>Madame Koski was a christian woman. She had been taught in the rough
   school of adversity, and she had learned, not only to submit with
   patience to the ills of life, but to see God’s gracious and merciful
   hand in all.</p>
  <p>Madame Koski’s income was not very large, still she insisted on sharing
   it with Michael and his wife, who really stood in need of aid, though
   they were unwilling to receive it from her. The good couple had done
   all without any hope or prospect of reward, but they both repeatedly
   declared that Gerald had already more than repaid them for the services
   they had rendered him by the generous sacrifice he had made, which had,
   they said, been the means of saving Michael’s life.</p>
  <p>Gerald returned with his mother to Moscow, and then commenced his
   studies with a cheerful spirit. He lived to be a comfort to his widowed
   parent, and an ornament to society; but he never had an opportunity of
   serving his country beyond what he could do as a private individual.</p>
  <p>Within two or three years of the time when the above related events
   took place, Peter the Great once more gained ascendancy over the Poles,
   by a victory he won over his rival Charles the Twelfth. In consequence
   of this victory, Stanislaus was deposed and Frederick Augustus was
   restored to the throne.</p>
  <p>Most of our young readers are no doubt aware that Poland is no longer a
   kingdom, but a Russian province. Subsequently to the period of which we
   have been speaking, the fall of the Polish nation was rapid, and their
   final overthrow took place about twenty years ago, under Nicholas, the
   present Emperor of Russia.</p>
  <p>It now remains for us, young readers, to inquire what moral may be
   learned from the little history before us. Every book we read should
   do something more than amuse the fancy and interest the feelings. It
   should inform our minds and teach us some valuable lesson for practice.
   We have seen that our hero’s generous action was made in the Providence
   of God to lead to its own reward. Had he not sought an interview with
   the Czar he would not have discovered his mother. Again we may observe,
   that circumstances do not affect the conduct of individuals so as to
   prevent the possibility of their performing noble deeds. The fisherman
   and his wife practised generosity and kindness of the highest order,
   lowly and poor though they were; and the seemingly disadvantageous
   situation of the boy who was cast upon their bounty did not prevent
   his achieving a truly heroic action. Think not, therefore, that your
   circumstances, whatever they may be, shut you out from the exercise of
   exalted virtues, for there are no circumstances, however unfavourable,
   which exclude the performance of generous and self-denying deeds.</p>
