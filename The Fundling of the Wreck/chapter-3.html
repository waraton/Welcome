  </h2>
  <p>Ten years glided away and very little change took place in the
   fisherman’s family, excepting that the infant foundling grew up, by
   degrees, into a fine intelligent boy. In the long nights of the Russian
   winter, unless there is some kind of mental employment, time passes
   very wearily. Michael had so far profited by his father’s instructions,
   as to be able to impart the elements of useful knowledge to Gerald,
   who was both an apt and eager scholar. His natural intelligence had
   thus been quickened, and his thirst for knowledge increased by the
   humble but useful instructions of his kind foster father. While they
   used to sit round the large warm stove, when they had read from the
   Bible or some other of the one or two books, which Michael inherited
   from his father, Michael would then relate incidents in the history of
   Sweden, or talk about the great protestant reformers—or the learned
   men his father had known or heard of at Upsal, his native city. Gerald
   was never tired of hearing about these things, and the thoughts that
   came into his mind when Michael talked about the famous university
   of Upsal, where so many people passed their time in acquiring or
   imparting knowledge were quite exciting, and he could not help hoping
   that something or other might occur that would place him in the way of
   acquiring more knowledge than he was likely to obtain in the hut of a
   poor fisherman, dearly as he loved his kind benefactors. Gerald was a
   good and grateful child, and desirous of doing all he could to assist
   those generous friends who had acted the part of parents to him. Even
   when quite a little boy, he tried to help his father, as he called him,
   in his craft. He was very fond too, of his good mother, as he called
   Margaret, and you may be sure they loved him very dearly.</p>

  <p>Previous to the reign of Peter the great, the Russian empire had been
   far behind the other nations of Europe in the progress of civilization.
   Even the highest classes amongst the people were extremely ignorant,
   very few of them could even read or write, and they spent the principal
   part of their time in feasting and drinking. They had neither ships,
   nor sailors, and no manufacturing class of people, except a few of
   the serfs who worked for the sole benefit of their masters. The fine
   arts were unknown, and the most useful arts were very imperfectly
   understood. At that time Peter, shared the throne with his elder
   brother, Ivan; but Ivan, being only a little above an idiot in mind,
   was a mere cipher. Peter, on the contrary, was possessed of a powerful
   intellect and great sagacity, and he had moreover an enterprising
   spirit. One of his early acts on ascending the throne, was, to send
   a number of the young nobles of his court into Italy, Germany, and
   Holland, to gain instruction in military and naval affairs. He also
   sent to foreign countries for ship-builders and various artisans, but
   not satisfied with that, he afterwards resolved on visiting some of
   those countries himself, for the express purpose of learning how his
   own kingdom might best be benefited.</p>
  <p>In pursuance of this plan, he, together with a few chosen associates,
   first went to Holland, at which place he worked as a common labourer in
   the dockyards, no one but those of his own party knowing who he was. He
   next came to England. It was his purpose to visit Italy likewise, but a
   revolt amongst his people at home, and rumours that his sister Sophia
   was trying to make herself empress of
   Russia, obliged him to return
   after an absence of only two years.</p>
  <p>Having now acquired considerable knowledge in ship-building and other
   valuable arts, Peter began to see the advantages which would accrue to
   his country, by the establishment of a port on the Baltic sea, at the
   mouth of the Neva. There were many difficulties in the way of such an
   undertaking, and one of the most formidable was, the low marshy state
   of the land. These difficulties however, he determined upon conquering.
   Had the Czar attempted to accomplish the same ends by justifiable
   means, we should admire his forethought and genius, but as on the
   contrary, he carried them out by force and cruelty, every humane heart
   must condemn the act as one of tyranny and oppression. No seemingly
   desirable end can justify us in using unlawful means.</p>
  <p>To provide workmen for the undertaking, the Emperor in the year 1703,
   sent bands of soldiers into the villages with orders to compel those
   men who were capable of labour to engage in the task. Our young
   friends have no doubt heard of the press gangs which were at one time
   allowed in England, and of the conscription in France. Well, this was
   a somewhat similar procedure, only instead of being forced to become
   sailors and soldiers, as the pressed men and conscripts were, these
   poor people were compelled to make roads and rear a city in an immense
   bog. The peasants, or serfs, as they are called in Russia, were at
   that period in a very degraded state. They were considered as much
   the property of the nobles on whose estates they lived, as any other
   live stock. Their houses mostly consisted of but one room. In the
   centre of this room was a large brick oven: in this they baked their
   black rye bread; and the top served for a bed for the whole family at
   night. Their only articles of furniture were, a lamp suspended from the
   ceiling, and a rough bench or two fastened
   to the walls. They were
   clothed in sheepskins, and their food was of the coarsest kind. Bad
   as was their lot, however, very few, if any of them, were willing to
   exchange it for labour on public works of any kind, especially in such
   an unhealthy situation as the marshes we have spoken of. The impure air
   which rises from swampy ground is almost sure to bring on fevers and
   other disorders. Then no care was taken to make them as comfortable as
   the circumstances would have permitted; no houses were provided for
   them to sleep in, and the tools they had given them to work with were
   so unsuitable and bad, that their labours were thereby made much harder
   than they would otherwise have been.</p>
  <p>Exposed thus to hardships of every kind, the men, as might be expected,
   perished by hundreds. But these disastrous results were not allowed to
   interrupt the work: for as fast as they died off, others were pressed
   into the service and marched off to the place. In Russia the Emperor
   has absolute power over all his subjects: even the nobles, therefore,
   dared not to oppose the mandate, had they been so disposed. Among the
   unhappy individuals who were chosen for the purpose of filling up
   vacancies made by the sick and deceased, was our friend Michael Kopt.
   His general home being away from any of the villages, he, for some
   time, escaped observation; but when strong, healthy men became scarce
   in the neighbourhood, he and some of his companions were pressed into
   the service, only a few minutes being given them for preparing, and
   bidding adieu to their weeping friends.</p>
  <p>Poor Margaret was for some time inconsolable, and Gerald was almost
   in as much grief at seeing her suffer. He tried to cheer her by every
   means in his power; but finding that she was hopeless of ever having
   her husband back again, he formed a resolution which our young readers
   shall hear at another time.</p>
