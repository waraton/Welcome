    <span class="small">AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CZAR.</span>
  </h2>
  <p>Gerald was true to his appointment, and he found the Prince prepared
    to receive him. But few words were exchanged; Mentzikoff beckoned him
    to follow, and they proceeded together to the Czar’s hut. It is an odd
    fancy for an Emperor to live in such a place when he might live in a
    grand palace, thought our hero; however, he wisely kept his thoughts to
    himself.</p>
  <p>Peter had been put out of temper the night before, by meeting with some
    trifling opposition to his wishes and plans; and the minister, though a
    very great favourite with his sovereign, was not quite sure that even
    he could get a hearing at that time. He had taken a fancy to Gerald,
    however, and he was determined to do all he could to serve him. Bidding
    him, therefore, wait without till he called or sent to him, Mentzikoff
    entered the Czar’s hut alone.</p>
  <p>Peter was up as usual and busy with his plans for the new city. The
    Prince did not, therefore, at once state the object of his early visit,
    but quietly listened to all his sovereign had to say. After a while,
    however, he ventured to lay the business before him.</p>
  <p>The Emperor’s brow darkened and became more and more contracted as the
    Prince proceeded. <q>What were the boors made for but to serve their
    country in that way?</q> he fiercely asked.</p>
  <p><q>True, Sire;</q> returned the Prince, <q>but this poor man is it appears
    unable to serve his country by manual labour any longer, and as the
    youth is so desirous of taking his place the
    exchange will be for your
    Majesty’s benefit.</p>
  <p><q>Bring him hither,</q> was the Czar’s abrupt rejoinder.</p>
  <p>Gerald was the next minute ushered into the presence of the Emperor.</p>
  <p><q>Come here, boy,</q> he cried in a loud stern voice.</p>
  <p>Gerald obeyed, but without shewing any signs of alarm.</p>
  <p><q>Thou’rt not Russian?</q> the Czar added, surveying his person with a
    scrutinizing glance.</p>
  <p><q>I know not to what country I belong, Sire,</q> the youth replied; <q>I was
    shipwrecked on the coast hard by, and I owe my life and everything else
    I possess to Michael Kopt.</q></p>
  <p><q>And who is Michael Kopt?</q></p>
  <p><q>Sire, Michael Kopt is the man whose place in the public works I wish
    to fill.</q></p>
  <p><q>Thou art of too slight a make for such work, boy,</q> cried the Czar.</p>
  <p><q>Nay, I have a stronger arm than I may seem to have, Sire; and if
    anything can nerve it for the work surely gratitude will do so.</q></p>
  <p><q>By what name art thou called?</q> demanded the Emperor.</p>
  <p><q>My name is Gerald, Sire.</q></p>
  <p><q>And how many years ago was it that thou wert shipwrecked on these
    shores?</q></p>
  <p><q>It was a little more than twelve years ago, Sire, I was then an infant
    of only a few months old.</q></p>
  <p><q>And you have never heard anything of your parents or friends?</q></p>
  <p><q>Never, Sire. The river was at that time beginning to overflow its
    banks, and I have reason to believe that I was the only person who
    escaped the wreck.</q></p>
  <p>The Czar mused for a few moments, then snatching up a piece of
    parchment from the table before him, he wrote a few words upon it, and
    gave it into the hand of the minister.</p>
  <p><q>Give the boy that, Mentzikoff,</q> he said; <q>let him present it to the
    master of the works, and his request will be promptly attended to.</q></p>
  <p>The Prince handed the parchment to Gerald who took it with a
    countenance radiant with delight. He could not speak, but making a low
    obeisance first to the Czar and then to the minister, he withdrew from
    the royal presence.</p>
  <p>As may be supposed, our hero lost no time in returning to the cottage
    with the joyful news of his success. But much as they all loved
    Michael, Margaret and the old people could scarcely rejoice in the
    thought of his restoration to his home when his liberty was to be
    purchased at such a cost. To the grateful boy, however, every task
    seemed light, and even his humiliation appeared honourable. Nor was
    this a delusive idea, for the most laborious employment derives dignity
    from a noble motive.</p>
  <p>The different circumstances under which Michael and Gerald commenced
    the same task made a wide difference in their feelings when engaged
    in it. With the former it was compulsory, with the latter it was
    voluntary. Michael felt himself to be the unwilling servant of a
    tyrannical master. Gerald overlooked the fact of working for the
    emperor in the animating idea that he was conferring a benefit on
    those who had done so much for him. He had moreover the delightful
    consciousness that his sacrifice of self met with the smile of his
    Father in Heaven. Nor did Gerald repent of the noble sacrifice he had
    made, when the first excitement was over, and he came to endure the
    severe, and in some instances, unexpected hardships it had brought
    upon him. He not only commenced his work cheerfully, but continued to
    pursue it with the same happy spirit. His joy and thankfulness were
    unbounded when he received intelligence that Michael was gradually
    recovering his health under Margaret’s careful nursing. At length
    the good woman herself came to visit him, bringing the news that her
    husband was now so nearly restored that he hoped to be able to walk as
    far himself ere long. Gerald thought, however, that it would not be
    wise for him to come, lest it being known that he was again capable
    of labour, he should be pressed a second time into the service, and
    his fears were not without foundation; for where there is a despotic
    government, the humbler classes of the people are looked upon as little
    better than machines, made for the sole purpose of executing the plans
    of those in power.</p>
