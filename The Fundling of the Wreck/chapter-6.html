   <span class="small">AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER.</span>
  </h2>
  <p>Leaving it to Margaret to explain to the old people the reason for his
   absence, Gerald started the next morning soon after dawn. When she
   saw him ready to set out, the good woman almost repented of having
   consented to his going; still she made no attempt to dissuade him from
   his purpose. She provided him with the best food the cottage could
   afford, and with tears in her eyes, bade him “God speed.” The day was
   favourable, and he tripped along with a light heart and a light step.
   No one, to see him, would have imagined that he was seeking to be
   placed in circumstances, at the thought of which many stout-hearted men
   quailed. He did not dwell however, on the hardships and dangers that
   might await him; he only thought of how he should gladden the spirits
   of those who had so long acted the part of parents to him. He knew that
   they would be grieved to purchase their own comfort at the sacrifice
   of his liberty, and it might be of his health also; but he hoped that
   his youth and good constitution would enable him to bear the toil for a
   time, <q>and perhaps,</q> thought he, <q>I may find favour in the sight of the
   Czar, and he may not doom me to spend all my best days at such work.</q></p>
  <p>In his way to the island where the Emperor’s humble court was kept,
   Gerald passed the spot where Michael’s cottage had once stood, the spot
   where he had been rescued by his kind guardian from a watery grave. The
   view of this place, and the recollections it called forth, seemed to
   give him new strength and spirit for his undertaking and though wearied
   with his journey, he went on even brisker than before.</p>
  <p>Some of the fishermen’s huts were still occupied, and Gerald stopped at
   one of them to inquire his way. One of the men directed him, supposing
   him to be the bearer of a message from some person in authority; for he
   took the precaution to keep his plan secret from every body, lest the
   telling it should by any means mar its success.</p>
  <p>It was nearly dark when he reached that part of the river’s banks which
   faced the island, but late as it was he resolved on trying to get over
   that night. While he was standing considering what would be the best
   means to adopt, three men came within sight, and jumped into a boat
   which was moored hard by. Gerald ran eagerly down to the beach, calling
   loudly to attract their attention, <q>May I ask, whither are you going my
   friends.</q></p>
  <p><q>We are servants of his excellency, Prince Mentzikoff, and are going to
   his house,</q> replied one of the men.</p>
  <p><q>Will you row me over with you?</q> asked Gerald, at the same time holding
   out a small coin.</p>
  <p><q>Have you any business with his excellency?</q> inquired one.</p>
  <p><q>My business is with the Czar, but I should be glad to see Prince
   Mentzikoff first, if I could get admittance to him,</q> Gerald replied.</p>
  <p><q>What is your business with the Czar?</q> demanded another.</p>
  <p><q>I have a favour to ask of him.</q></p>
  <p><q>If that’s the case, you cannot do better than get his excellency to
   introduce you,</q> rejoined the first speaker; <q>come hasten into the boat,
   we must not tarry, or we shall be put into too hot an oven, and so
   repent of it.</q></p>
  <p>This speech of the man’s had reference to the prime minister’s origin.
   Mentzikoff was, when a boy, in the service of a pastry-cook at
   Moscow, and he first attracted the attention of the Emperor by the
   humorous manner in which he sang a song extolling his master’s pies.
   Peter offered him a menial office in his household, but afterwards
   discovering that he had a genius for military affairs, he placed him in
   his army, where he rose rapidly. This young man was one of the Czar’s
   companions on his journey to Holland and England.</p>
  <p>As the men rowed the boat across the river, one commenced a song, and
   the others joined in chorus. The Russian people are noted for their
   love of music, and they generally lighten their labours by singing.</p>
  <p>On reaching the island, they conducted our hero at once to the house of
   the minister.</p>
  <p>The house of Prince Mentzikoff was very superior to the one occupied by
   his sovereign, for Peter took pride in demeaning himself when he was
   in the mood to do so; still it was but a
   rude affair, as our young
   readers will no doubt think when they hear it described.</p>
  <p>It consisted of a number of wooden beams, so prepared as to fit readily
   into each other. Lattices and shutters for windows were also made to
   fit in, and these detached pieces could be packed up and carried to
   any place that the owner chose to reside in. Most of the houses in the
   towns and cities of Russia were, at that time, so constructed; and
   ready-made houses were common articles of merchandise in the public
   markets. The furniture of these dwellings was as rough and portable as
   the outside; a few shelves and some wooden benches were fixed to the
   walls, and a few tables were added. The benches served for bedsteads as
   well as for seats, and when these houses were put up in the country, it
   was seldom that they afforded the luxury of a bed.</p>
  <p>Little ceremony was used at that period, especially in such a retired
   place, and Gerald was introduced at once into the presence of the
   Prince. Mentzikoff was seated on one of the benches, having a table
   before him, on which stood a bottle of spirits and a large horn cup.
   He had evidently been drinking rather too freely, which bad practice,
   though sanctioned by the example of the Czar, and the custom of
   the country, was a new spectacle to our hero, who had always been
   accustomed to see sobriety in his humble home.</p>
  <p><q>What is your business with me?</q> the Prince somewhat roughly demanded
   as Gerald advanced.</p>
  <p><q>Will your excellency do me the favour of introducing me to the Czar
   before he leaves the island in the morning?</q> Gerald said, at the same
   time making a low bow.</p>
  <p><q>For what purpose do you wish to be introduced to his Majesty?’
   Mentzikoff abruptly asked.</p>
  <p><q>Please your excellency, I have a favour to request.</q></p>
  <p><q>What, boor? Dost thou think to enter the Czar’s service? Thou art a
   dainty lad for thy station, but thou’rt not quite to his mind I fancy.</q></p>
  <p><q>I do wish to enter the Czar’s service,</q> Gerald replied; <q>my request is
   that he will let me labour on the public works.</q></p>
  <p>The minister looked up as if doubting whether he heard aright:—<q>Art
   thou in earnest, boy,</q> he demanded, <q>or art thou jesting with me?’</p>
  <p><q>I would not take the liberty to jest with your excellency,</q> Gerald
   replied: <q>indeed my errand is not a matter for jest. I am in earnest. I
   wish to take the place of a man who has been more than a father to me.</q></p>
  <p><q>Ha!’</p>
  <p><q>One Michael Kopt, once a fisherman on the Neva, has been upwards of
   two years upon the works, but his strength is failing, he can now be
   but of little use to his Majesty, and I have a strong arm.</q></p>
  <p><q>Come hither at the dawn of day,</q> said the Prince.</p>
  <p>Gerald again bowed, and was about to leave the room, when Mentzikoff
   calling after him said, <q>Bid my servants find thee a lodging and a
   meal,</q> and added, <q>come hither at the dawn, I’ll take thee to the Czar
   myself.</q> Here he turned aside to re-fill the horn cup and quaff off
   another draught of spirits.</p>
