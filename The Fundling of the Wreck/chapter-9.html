   <span class="small">OUR HERO AT THE COURT OF PETER THE GREAT.</span>
  </h2>
  <p>On entering the palace Gerald was at once taken to a comfortable
   apartment, and supplied with refreshment. <q>Surely,</q> thought he, <q>the
   Czar has some kind intentions respecting me, or he would not give
   orders that I should be treated in this manner;</q> and he was much
   relieved by this thought. Having finished his meal, he was conducted by
   a domestic or slave (for all the domestics in Russia were slaves) to
   one of the baths prepared for the household, and then to a wardrobe,
   from whence a handsome robe was given him to put on in the place of his
   sheepskin garments. He was further told that he would most likely be
   summoned to attend on the Emperor in the evening.</p>
  <p>The robe in which Gerald was arrayed was of dark green cloth, trimmed
   with fur. It was loose and flowing, only confined round the waist by a
   leathern girdle, in the manner of the dresses of the east. This kind of
   dress was in fashion in Russia at that time, though Peter afterwards,
   with some difficulty induced the Russian nobles and citizens to give it
   up, and adopt the costumes of England and France.</p>
  <p>The change was certainly a great improvement to our hero’s appearance;
   and he began to wonder what all this would lead to.</p>
  <p>With evening the expected summons came, and Gerald was conducted by a
   superior officer of the household to the royal presence. The Emperor
   was not now, as when our hero first saw him seated on a rude bench,
   but on a throne of state. He did not wear the gorgeous robe in which
   he had attended the church in the morning,
   for that was held sacred
   to the occasion, but he was dressed in one equally splendid. A number
   of nobles and ladies elegantly attired, stood on either side of the
   throne, and the blaze of light which was thrown upon the company by
   means of the brilliant chandeliers, gave the whole scene a dazzling
   aspect.</p>
  <p>The Czar and his suite were greatly amused at observing the wonder and
   admiration which marked the expressive countenance of the youth, as he
   entered the grand saloon. Gerald’s thoughts, were not however, long so
   occupied, he was too much interested in ascertaining the object of his
   summons there.</p>
  <p><q>Ha! my lad,</q> exclaimed the Czar, in a familiar tone, as Gerald bowed
   low before the throne, <q>I’ve not forgotten you, you see. Well, how did
   you get on at your new work?</q></p>
  <p><q>I hope, Sire,</q> Gerald replied with modest dignity, <q>I hope, Sire, I
   did my duty, and to the satisfaction of your Majesty’s officers.</q></p>
  <p><q>I’ve heard nothing to the contrary, at all events,</q> said the Czar,
   <q>but what say you to leaving off that sort of work, and taking to
   something else? Have you become so fond of it that you desire to end
   your days at it?</q></p>
  <p>Gerald could not help smiling at this question. <q>Nay, Sire,</q> he
   replied, <q>I did my work cheerfully, because I felt it to be my duty to
   do so, and I had moreover, an animating motive, but I should rejoice to
   be engaged in some employment better suited to my taste.</q></p>
  <p><q>What employment would be suited to your taste?</q> the Emperor asked.
   <q>Would you like to be a soldier?</q></p>
  <p><q>A soldier’s profession would not be quite suited to my taste, Sire,</q>
   Gerald replied.</p>
  <p><q>Why? it is thought to be the most honourable calling by many of my
   subjects. I am a soldier, myself, but I wish not to put a restraint on
   your inclination—nay, should you prefer
   following some useful art, I
   would give you all encouragement. My nobles here know that I patronise
   the useful arts, and have set them an example by working at some of
   them myself.</q></p>
  <p><q>My inclination, Sire, has always been to pursue a studious life,</q>
   Gerald ventured to say.</p>
  <p><q>Ha!</q> exclaimed the Czar, <q>I am now founding a university in Moscow,
   would you like to enter it?</q></p>
  <p><q>That is what I desire above all things, Sire,</q> Gerald replied with
   great earnestness.</p>
  <p><q>Your desire shall be gratified then,</q> cried the Emperor, <q>I wish to
   serve you, but I had another object in bringing you here. I took notice
   of the account you gave me at our former meeting of your singular
   deliverance from shipwreck, and I think I have some clue to the
   discovery of your family.</q></p>
  <p>Gerald looked up more earnestly than ever. <q>To enable me to discover my
   kindred, would indeed, Sire, be conferring on me a favour beyond any
   other,</q> he exclaimed with great energy.</p>
  <p><q>Can you write?</q></p>
  <p><q>Yes, Sire, I can write, though but indifferently. My good father,
   Michael Kopt, taught me to write to the best of his ability.</q></p>
  <p><q>Good—make out a clear statement then of all you know concerning your
   earlier history, in writing—be very particular as to dates, and send
   the document to me. You may withdraw now. My servants will attend to
   your comfort and provide you with anything you ask for.</q></p>
  <p><q>Oh! Sire,</q> exclaimed the youth, bursting into a flood of tears, <q>I
   can find no words to express my gratitude. But my heart thanks you a
   thousandfold.</q></p>
  <p>Peter was naturally a stern man, and not easily moved, but he could not
   witness the youth’s emotions without feeling something like a response.</p>
  <p>Gerald still lingered at the foot of the throne. <q>Will your Majesty
   pardon me if I ask the addition of one favour more,</q> he at length said,
   <q>it is, that I may be permitted to send a messenger to my friends
   to let them know that I am here safe under your Majesty’s gracious
   protection.</q></p>
  <p><q>Aye, if that will afford you pleasure,</q> returned the emperor, smiling,
   and he waved his hand in token of an adieu.</p>
