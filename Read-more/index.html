            <p>Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you
                may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. - Romans 12:2</p>
            <p>Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they
                shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion. - Isaiah 52:8 </p>
            <p class="more"><sup>4</sup>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from
                him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his
                throne; <sup>5</sup>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the
                dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
                his own blood,
                <sup>6</sup>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion
                forever and ever. Amen. - Rev 1:4-6
            </p>
            <p class="more">But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly
                heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away
                from me. - Jeremiah 3:19</p>

            <p class="more"><sup>19</sup>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed
                it unto them.
                <sup>20</sup>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
                understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without
                excuse:
                <sup>21</sup>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but
                became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. - Romans 1:19-21
