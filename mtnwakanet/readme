# @page CSS rule

The @page rule in CSS is used to customize the appearance of printed pages, such as their size, orientation, and margins. Within the @page rule, only a limited set of properties are allowed. These properties are specifically designed for controlling the layout and style of printed pages.

## Notes

1. Pseudo-classes: You can use pseudo-classes like @page :first to style the first page differently.
1. Browser Support: Not all properties are supported across all browsers, so testing is essential for consistent results.
1. Limitations: Most other CSS properties (e.g., background, font, etc.) are not allowed within @page.

This rule is particularly useful for creating professional-looking printed documents directly from web pages.
